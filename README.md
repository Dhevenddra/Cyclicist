## Scenario
Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. The company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic‚Äôs finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends

## Characters and teams 
- Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can‚Äôt use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
- Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
- Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic‚Äôs mission and business goals ‚Äî as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
- Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## 6. Act

### Guiding questions

Casual riders mostly use the service for leisure activities as they travel a lot during weekends while annual members seem to use the service for daily commute
2. How could your team and business apply your insights? 
The marketing team can target casual rider profiles, bring in luring subscription plans, introduce counter productive subscription system such as an increase in casual usage price while decreasing annual pricing system. Introduce cheaper, cost-effective plans during times where there is a dip in usage.
3. What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?
Stakeholders can decide if the marketing strategy produced on the results would provide positive results, they can decide if they need to have an strong advertising system in less popular areas .
4. Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?
Yes. The data doesn‚Äôt specify external conditions such as climate, economic condition of an area and the data is obtained during the time of pandemic which could have resulted in shorter commutes at certain months. There is no information about the persons age or gender or job.

Marketing recommendations to convert casual riders into members:

##### üö©  Marketing effort on the top 5 most popular stations for the causal riders. It can be a booth, print media on the bike or the locking station area, or social media post on contest starting from the most popular stations. 

##### ‚õ±  Promotional short term membership offer during the summer months.

##### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Promotional weekend term membership for the weekends.
